In JSDom (v15.1.1), `form.elements` does not include form elements defined outside the form hierarchy with attribute `form='form-id'`.

The following form has an input element defined outside the hierarchy.

If we get `document.forms[0].elements`, we expect a list containing one element. Instead, the list is empty.

```html
<form id='test-form'></form>
<input type='text' name='test' form='test-form' />
```

See equivalent test in a browser: https://jsfiddle.net/fthompson/2njuLq3r/2/

Previous PRs add support for the `form` attribute in some capacity, including support for submit buttons outside the form, but the previous PR apparently does not cover the full HTML spec.
